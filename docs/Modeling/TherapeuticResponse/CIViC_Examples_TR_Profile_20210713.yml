# CIVIC Assertion6 (AID6) record, along with one of its six Evidence Lines
# See  https://civicdb.org/events/assertions/6/summary (website record), https://civicdb.org/api/assertions/6 (API payload)

# This VA data example is rooted at a 'domain level statement' - but we are experimenting wiht making this an Evidence Level Assertion
# It does not use Propositions for 'asserted proposition' semantics, but does demonstrate their use for explicitly representing the "target proposition" of an EID / Evidence Line.  Propositions are being explored in this way as a means to formally link the products of Evidence Curation and Assertion activities - through their shared / related Propositions.  
# Note that the prefixes "civic-data" and civic-term" reflect made-up namespaces for native CIViC identifiers.
