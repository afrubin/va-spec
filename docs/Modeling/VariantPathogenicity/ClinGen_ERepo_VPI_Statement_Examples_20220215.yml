# Example representations of variant pathogenicity classification from the ClinGen ERepo
# Several classification outcomes are demonstrated, for two modeling approaches: (1) The Evidence Level Statement Approach, using a 1-predicate model; and (2) the Domain Statement Approach, with Propositions, using a 3-predicate model
# Tabular representations for the cross-product of all classification outcomes x modeling approaches can be found in the spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bJEFWP8BBYYCLg_k2l6kekyQbhatHQEQ--Jr2y6EPBo/edit#gid=1045853565
