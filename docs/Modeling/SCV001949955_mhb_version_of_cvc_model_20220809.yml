# Inlined SEPIO-VA representation of the ClinVar record Larry and Alex used to demonstrate the metakb-cvc model (SCV001949955), as of 8-9-22
# This representation is compliant with a draft GA4GH Base 'Variant Pathogenicity Classification' Profile, which applies the 'Evidence Level Statement' paradigm.
# The data record used for this example was Larry/Alex's file: https://github.com/ga4gh/va-spec/blob/metakb-cvc/tests/fixtures/VA-ClinVar-SCV-Example-001.yaml (which I modified to better align with the VA Core IM and proposed pathogenicity profile)
# All modifications made to better align wiht the VA Core model have been described in comments (there are primarily simple name changes).

description: 'The c.6644C>A (NM_004958.4) variant in MTOR is a missense variant predicted
  to cause substitution of (p.Ser2215Tyr). This variant is absent from gnomAD v2.1.1
  (PM2_Supporting). MTOR, in which the variant was identified, is defined by the ClinGen
  Brain Malformations Expert Panel as a gene that has a low rate of benign missense
  variation and where pathogenic missense variants are a common mechanism of disease
  (PP2). A different amino acid change (p.Ser2215Phe), at this locus, is classified
  as pathogenic for Overgrowth with or without cerebral malformations due to abnormalities
  in MTOR-pathway genes by the ClinGen BMEP (PM5). This variant has been shown to
  significantly increase phosphorylation levels in experiments with case and controls
  cells of similar isogenic backgrounds indicating that this variant impacts protein
  function (PMIDs: 20190810, 24631838, 28963468) (PS3_Supporting). The prevalence
  of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared with
  the prevalence in controls (PS4; PMID: 27830187, 29281825, 225401301, 26619011;
  identified in 5 individuals with neuropathology confirmatory of a malformation of
  cortical development, 1 individual with neuroimaging appearance consistent with
  a malformation of cortical development (without neuropathology), 1 individual with
  neuroimaging demonstrating at least one large cerebral hemisphere with cortical
  malformation(s), 15 tumor samples in the literature and COSMIC). Testing of unaffected
  and affected tissue show variable allelic fractions consistent with a post-zygotic
  event (PS2_Moderate; PMID: 26018084). In summary, this variant meets the criteria
  to be classified as Pathogenic for mosaic autosomal dominant overgrowth with or
  without cerebral malformations due to abnormalities in MTOR-pathway genes based
  on the ACMG/AMP criteria applied, as specified by the ClinGen Brain Malformations
  Expert Panel: PM2_P, PP2, PM5, PS3_P, PS4, PS2_M; 11 points (VCEP specifications
  version 1; Approved: 1/31/2021)'
