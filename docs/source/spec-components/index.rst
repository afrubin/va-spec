Specification Components
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The VA Specification is comprised of four key components:

:ref:`core-im`: test

:ref:`domain-analysis-model`: test

1. :ref:`domain-analysis-model`: A conceptual framework for understanding the processes and participants involved in evidence-based knowledge generation

   * Provides a foundational terminology and understanding of the domain, and shared perspective from which to approach data creation and modeling tasks 
   
   
1. `Domain Analysis Model <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spec-components/domain-analysis-model.html>`__: A conceptual framework for understanding the processes and participants involved in evidence-based knowledge generation

# :ref:`domain-analysis-model`: A conceptual framework for understanding the processes and participants involved in evidence-based knowledge generation
    Provides a foundational terminology and understanding of the domain, and shared perspective from which to approach data creation and modeling tasks 


1. **Domain Analysis Model:**  A conceptual framework for understanding the processes and participants involved in evidence-based knowledge generation
    
    Provides a foundational terminology and understanding of the domain, and shared perspective from which to approach data creation and modeling tasks 

2. **Core Information Model:** A domain-agnostic information model for structuring knowledge statements and their supporting evidence and provenance.
     
     Provides the foundation on which to build ‘Profiles’ that specialize the Core IM for specific statement types or data applications. 
     
3. **Profile Catalog:** A repository of sharable and extensible Profiles, including *Implementation Profiles* tailoired for a specific data systems, and *GA4GH Standard Profiles* for broader community use. 

     Provides examples of the Profiling proces, and facilitates coordinated development of models by enabling implementers to re-use and build on existing work.  

4. **Reference Implementations:** A library of software and services that demonstrate the creation, validation, and exchange of standards compliant data. 

     Provides implementers with working code to apply or adapt for their applications
