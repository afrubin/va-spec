Specification Components
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The VA Specification is comprised of four key components:

1. **Domain Analysis Model:**  A conceptual framework for understanding the processes and participants involved in evidence-based knowledge generation
    
    Provides a foundational terminology and understanding of the domain, and shared perspective from which to approach data creation and modeling tasks 

2. **Core Information Model:** A domain-agnostic information model for structuring knowledge statements and their supporting evidence and provenance.
     
     Provides the foundation on which to build ‘Profiles’ that specialize the Core IM for a specific statement types and data applications. 
     
3. **Profile Catalog:** A repository of sharable and extensible Profiles, including 'Implementation Profiles' tailoired for a specific data systems, and 'GA4GH Standard Profiles' representing standards for broader community use. 

     Provides examples of the Profiling proces, and facilitates coordinated development of models by enabling implementers to re-use and build on existing work.  

4. **Reference Implementations:** A library of software and services that demonstrate the creation, validation, and exchange of standards compliant data. 

     Provides implementers with working code to apply or adapt for their applications
