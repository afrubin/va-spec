Overview
@@@@@@@@
The foundational component of the VA-Spec is the Core Information Model (Core IM), which defines domain-agnostic structures for representing statements of knowledge and the evidence and provenance supporting them. In scope for the VA-Spec are statements made about genetic variation, but the Core IM can be used to make statements about entities of any kind. The model itself is based on the information model provided by the `SEPIO Framework <https://github.com/monarch-initiative/SEPIO-ontology>`__ - on which the majority of Core IM class definitions are derived. As the most mature and impactful implementer of the SEPIO framework, the VA Team is working directly with SEPIO to facilitate the coordinated evolution of these two specifications.
