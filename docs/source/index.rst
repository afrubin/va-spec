GA4GH Variant Annotation Specification
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The **Variant Annotation Specification (VA-Spec)** is a standard developed by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) to facilitate sharing of biological and clinical knowledge about molecular variation (aka 'variants'). It provides a **set of standard models** for exchanging specific kinds of Statements about variants, and a **modeling framework** supporting community-driven development of these models as 'profiles' of a foundational **Core Information Model**. 
	
Consult the documentation on this site for information about the specification and how to use it:
 * **Introduction**: An entry point for understanding the VA-Spec through a high-level overview, concrete examples, and links to more detailed content.
 * **Quick Start Guide**: Directs implementers to resources needed to begin working with the VA-Spec, defining specific modes of use.
 * **Core Information Model**: Detailed descriptions of the classes and attributes in the foundational Core-IM.
 * **Standard Profiles**: Detailed descriptions of the Statement and Study Result Profiles provided as standards for representing variant knowledge. 
 * **Modeling Framework**: Specific instructions and resoruces for creating or refining profiles of the Core-IM to build new Statement models.
 * **FAQ**: Answers to commonly asked questions that provide deeper insight into specific aspects of the VA-Spec.
