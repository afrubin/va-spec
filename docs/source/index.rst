GA4GH Variant Annotation Specification
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The **Variant Annotation Specification (VA-Spec)** is a standard developed by the **Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)** to facilitate sharing of biological and clinical knowledge about molecular variation (aka 'variants'). It provides a **set of Standard Models** for exchanging specific kinds of Statements about variants, and a **Modeling Framework** supporting community-driven development of these models as 'profiles' of a **foundational Core Information Model**. 
	
Consult the documentation on this site for information about the specification and how to use it:
 * `Introduction <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html>`_: An entry point for understanding the VA-Spec through a high-level overview, concrete examples, and links to more detailed content.
 * `Quick Start Guide <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start-guide.html>`_: Directs implementers to resources needed to begin working with the VA-Spec, defining specific modes of use.
 * `Core Information Model <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core-information-model/index.html>`_: Detailed descriptions of the classes and attributes in the foundational Core-IM.
 * `Standard Profiles <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/standard-profiles/index.html>`_: Detailed descriptions of the Statement and Study Result Profiles provided as standards for representing variant knowledge. 
 * `Modeling Framework <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modeling-framework.html>`_: Specific instructions and resoruces for creating or refining profiles of the Core-IM to build new Statement models.
 * `FAQ <https://va-ga4gh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html>`_: Answers to commonly asked questions that provide deeper insight into specific aspects of the VA-Spec.
