The **Variant Annotation Specification (VA-Spec)** provides standard models for flexible and unambiguous representation of knowledge about molecular variation, along with supporting evidence and provenance information - to support exchange through GA4GH APIs and other data sharing mechanisms. 

Definitions and Scope:
######################

#. **VARIANT**: alternative forms of a genetic sequence, or its molecular manifestation in a biological system.  aka 'molecular variation'.

    * Sequence Variant -  changes in the sequence of a genome, transcript, or protein.
        * simple (e.g. SNV, indels) or complex (inversions, repeat regions) sequence changes
        * continuous (allele) or discontinuous (translocations) regions
        * in cis (e.g. haplotypes) or in trans (e.g. genotypes)  sets of variant regions
