schema: ga4gh-_va_prototype
comment: This is an exploratory mock-up of how the exemplar 'predictive' variant interpretation provided by the CliniGen somatic/MVLD WG might look like using a draft prototype of the GA4GH Variant Annotation model. The example is  based on the CIViC record here (https://civicdb.org/events/genes/19/summary/variants/34/summary/evidence/965/summary#evidence) (specifically evidence items 965 and 966 from this record).

Section I presents the source example data provided by the MVLD, using native MVLD fields.
Section II presents this same data modelled using the prototype GA4GH-VA model
Section III shows an 'enhanced' example that includes additional evidence information provided by the source CIViC record - to illustrate how SEPIO would represent this information as part of the GA4GH-VA model.

The overall objective tumor response rate was 51%. Among 127 patients with EGFR T790M who could be evaluated for response, the response rate was 61% (95% CI, 52 to 70). In contrast, among 61 patients without EGFR T790M, the response rate was 21% (95% CI, 12 to 34). The median progression-free survival was 9.6 months in EGFR T790M-positive patients and 2.8 months in EGFR T790M-negative patients."

          description: "Cell line, xenograft, and transgenic models were used to establish Osimertinib as an inhibitor of both EGFR mutation sensitizing (L858M, del exon 19) and T790M resistance mutants. Preclinically, the drug inhibits signaling pathways and cellular growth in both EGFRm(+) and EGFRm(+)/T790M(+) mutant cell lines in vitro, with lower activity against wild-type EGFR lines. Sustained tumor regression was observed in EGFR-mutant tumor xenograft and transgenic models. Treatment of 2 patients with advanced EGFRm(+) T790M(+) NSCLC was reported as proof of principle."
