description: 'The p.Gly285Ser variant in KCNQ4 has been reported in at least three
  individuals with hearing loss, and segregated with disease in over 15 affected relatives
  fr om two families (LMM unpublished data, Kubisch 1999, Wang 2014). It was absent
  f rom large population studies. In vitro functional studies support an impact on
  p rotein function and suggest that the variant may act in a dominant-negative mann
  er (Kubisch 1999, Bal 2008). Furthermore, the p.Gly285Ser variant falls within t
  he highly conserved pore-forming region of KCNQ4 (Oza 2018). Supporting the into
  lerance of this position to variation, a different amino acid change at the same
  position (p.Gly285Cys) has been reported in one family with hearing loss (Couck
  e 1999). Finally, this variant was classified as Pathogenic on 9/11/2018 by the
  ClinGen-approved Hearing Loss Expert Panel (Variation ID 6241). In summary, this
  variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for autosomal dominant no
  nsyndromic hearing loss. ACMG/AMP criteria applied: PP1_Strong, PM1, PM2, PP3, P
  S3_Supporting, PS4_Supporting.'
