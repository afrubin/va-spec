      confidence_level:
        type: string
        enum: [ "strong", "likely", "uncertain" ]
        description: >-
          A qualitative term describing the degree of confidence held by the creator of the information entity, 
          that the information it represents is true.
      confidence_score:
        type: DataItem
        description: >-
          A quantitative score reflecting the degree of confidence held by the creator of the information 
          entity, that the information it represents is true.

  Statement:
    inherits: InformationEntity
    description: >-
      A Statement (aka ‘Assertion’) represents a claim of purported truth as made by a particular agent, 
      on a particular occasion.
    heritable_properties:
      target_proposition:
        $ref: "#/$defs/Proposition"
        description: The Proposition about which the Statement is made.
      conclusion:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The conclusion drawn from the statement proposition, significance, confidence level, and/or 
          confidence score.
      significance:
        type: string
        enum: [ "supports", "uncertain", "refutes" ]
        description: >-
          The significance of this statement with respect to the target proposition.

  VariationPathogenicityStatement:
    inherits: Statement
    description: >-
      A :ref:`Statement` describing the pathogenicity of a variation.

  Proposition:
    inherits: gks.core:ValueEntity
    description: >-
      An abstract :ref:`ValueEntity` representing the shareable meaning that can be 
      put forth as true in a Statement.
    heritable_properties:
      subject:
        type:
          $ref: gks.core:ValueEntity
        description: >-
          The :ref:`ValueEntity` about which the Proposition is made.
      predicate:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The relationship asserted to hold between the subject and the object of the 
          Proposition.
      object:
        type:
          $ref: gks.core:ValueEntity
        description: >-
          A ValueEntity that is related to the subject of a Proposition via its predicate.
