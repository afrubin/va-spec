type: object

definitions:
  # Core IM class definitions are presented top-down, rooted at an abstract
  # 'Element' class from which all other classes in the model inherit. 
  # Class definitions are organized into three sections: 
  #
  # Common classes are generic classes that will ultimately be moved into a shared 
  # GKS foundation model, and imported into the VA Core IM schema here. These 
  # include 'Element' and 'Entity' classes. 
  #
  # Utility classes resemble 'complex datatypes', and provide re-usable collections
  # of fields that can be plugged into other objects to hold specific types of 
  # information. Some/all of these may also eventually live in a shared GKS
  # foundation model.
  #
  # Core classes include those used to represent Statements and their supporting
  # evidence and provenance information. These will live permanently in the Core IM.
  #
  # Fnally, Domain Entity classes representing entities in a particular domain, about
  # which statements are made and evidence is collected. These are defined in a 
  # separate domain-entities-source.yaml file, and referenced as needed from 
  # domain-specific Profiles of the Core IM.  They too will ultimately live in
  # a shared GKSfoundation model.
