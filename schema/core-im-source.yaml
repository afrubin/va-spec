type: object

definitions:
  # Core IM class definitions are presented top-down, rotted at an abstract
  # 'Element' class from which all other classes in the model inherit. 
  # Class definitions are  organized into four sections: 
  #
  # Common classes are generic classes that will ultimately be moved into a shared 
  # GKS foundation model, and imported into the VA Core IM schema here. These 
  # include Element and Entity classes. 
  #
  # Utility classes include complex datatype-like objects that provide re-usable 
  # collections of fields that can be plugged into other objects to hold related 
  # information. Some/all of these may also eventually live in a shared GKS
  # foundation model 
  #
  # Core Classes include classes used to represent Statements and their supporting
  # evidence and provenance information. These will live permanently in the Core IM.
  #
  # Domain Entity classes represent entities in the domain of discourse about which 
  # statements are made. These will also ultimately live in a shared GKS 
  # foundational model - but for now are defined in the Core IM schema itself.
