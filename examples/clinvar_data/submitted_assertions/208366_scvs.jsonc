            "description": "The c.806_808delCCT (p.Ser269del) variant in KCNQ4 has been observed in at least 4 probands with hearing loss (PS4_Supporting; PMID: 23399560, 23443030, LMM unpublished data SCV000967428.1). This variant segregated with hearing loss in 12 additional individuals from 1 family (PP1_Strong; PMID: 23443030). The p.Ser269del variant was absent from large population studies (PM2; https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org). This variant causes a change in the length of the protein due to an in-frame deletion between the S5 membrane-spanning domain and the pore region, which is important for protein function (PM4). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as likely pathogenic for autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. ACMG/AMP Criteria applied as specified by the Hearing Loss Expert Panel: PP1_Strong, PM2, PM4, PS4_Supporting. ",
